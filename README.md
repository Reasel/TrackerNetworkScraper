# TrackerNetworkScraper

This is a tool that allows you to get all MMR data for all playlists for Rocket League.

You can either do this for a single player by running: ```py TrackerNetworkScraper.py -g <gamertag> -p <platform>```
Or you can scrape an entire csv by running: ```py TrackerNetworkScraper.py -l <path to csv>```

The format of the csv is shown in both the output.csv and players.csv. Either of which you can import into a google sheet and export for your convenience.
